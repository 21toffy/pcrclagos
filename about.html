                                PCRC is a community policing based organization established by the Leadership of Nigeria Police Force since 1984 to foster partnership between the Police and the community with a view to enhance efficient and effective policing of communities in Nigeria. Members are drawn from all the strata of the society. It is non religious, political, gender, nor tribal biased but structured along police formations such as Divisions, Area commands, State commands, and Zonal commands up to National components. It has since been promoting the concept of community policing in Nigeria especially in Lagos State and as such deepening relations between the communities and police.

                                Consequently, the PCRC engages in information gathering and dissemination to appropriate Police authorities, provide logistics, medicals, moral and material support to the Police as much as possible. PCRC among other things, also engages in Advocacy, Capacity building, Workshops, Seminars, Public Campaigns and more importantly Police Public image laundering with a view to improve confidence  of  the  Public  in the  ability  of  the  Nigeria  Police to  secure the community.  We  often  collaborate  with  organizations/individuals/government agencies with such passion for improved security of lives and properties in our

                                We have recently be on the vanguard of campaign against drug abuse and cultism in the state especially among the secondary school students which has been a very serious concerned to all well-meaning Nigerians, We have also engaged various communities through our divisions and area command in community  participation  in  security  architecture  peculiar  to   various communities through town hall meetings, training   ,public  lectures  etc  .For example we have organised appropriate lectures and seminars for Okada Riders, NURTW members, Mechanics and allied professional associations on issues pertaining to security in their area s of work. Some of our leaders have been trained  ADR  Alternate  Dispute  Resolution  at  the Lagos State Citizen Mediation Center to improve on our capability on minor disputes in our various communities in conjunction with the Police. We shall soon launch the PCRC Traffic Support Corps to support all the traffic management agencies in the state like Police, LASTMA, Road safety with a view to demystify the chaotic traffic problem in the state. As a bridge between the police and the community we often engage the police personnel on their conducts, skills and countenances that would improve Police Community relations.

                                At this juncture, it is pertinent to also let you be aware that the PCRC has been funding all  these community engagement and support for the police mainly through our personal and collective contributions with support from few members of the society.
